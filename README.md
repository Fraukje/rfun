# Random fun in R
This repository contains random stuff I created in R, just because I can and for no other reason than that. Some have a nice back-story which I will share.

## Tic-Tac-Toe function
Who doesn't like a good game of Tic-Tac-Toe (Boter, Kaas en Eieren in Dutch)? A friend of mine with a none-coding background was interviewing for a developer job, and as an assessment she had to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. She asked me to help her out on how to approach this problem, and also challenged me to try it myself. Since I was recently picking up R, I took up her challenge and created this function.
